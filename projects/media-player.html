            <h2>• Media Player •</h2>
            <p>
                <u>Description</u>:<br>
                Content is the lifeforce of the web. Many projects rely on a user-interface created for the purpose of browsing media whether it be a gallery of images, a collection of texts, or a playlist of audio or video files. The way these navigational systems are built can have a huge impact on the tone or narrative of the media on display and can heighten a user's experience. In this project we will develop a curated set of media files and create an accompanying interface for exploring, browsing, and playback.
            </p>
            <u>Goals</u>:
            <ol>
                <li>Build a fully functional user-interface.</li>
                <li>Control video and/or audio files using JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Create a piece of object-like software that trancends the browser page.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <u>Guidelines</u>:<br>
                Your collection can include any type of files: audio, videos, images, text, or any combination of the previous. Whatever category you choose, please make sure there are at least 10 items to work with. Your player should include a set of controls like play/pause/next/previous/volume etc. These controls can be modified to fit your specific collection. The design should be carefully considered and utilize the entire page for an immersive experience.
