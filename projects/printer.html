                <u>Description</u>:<br>
                Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the
                use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system is generally one that is nonhuman
                and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise
                require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator
                may claim that the generative system represents their own artistic idea, and in
                others that the system takes on the role of the creator. Using JavaScript loops,
                create a generative work based on outputting rows of HTML/CSS which follow your
                own set of rules. Think of your website like a printer that changes every time
                the ink makes a pass over the page.
            </p>
            <u>Goals</u>:
            <ol>
                <li>Gain comfort with loops and conditional programming.</li>
                <li>Create a unique work that is both planned and unplanned.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <u>Guidelines</u>:<br>
                Your output can function and display however you like as long as it is created
                by a loop. Think about what content you would like to manipulate, you may use
                for example: colored divs, text, images, or more. The final printed piece can be
                a fixed pattern you create with the script or something that uses Math.random()
                to create something different every time.
