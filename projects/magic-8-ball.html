            <h2>• Magic 8 Ball •</h2>
            <p>
                <u>Description</u>:<br>
                The Magic 8-Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an eight-ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking
                advice. It was invented in 1950 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel. The user
                asks a yes–no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball. We will use HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript to recreate this real world object as a functional website.
            </p>
            <u>Goals</u>:
            <ol>
                <li>Manipulate an exisiting script to understand how its parts are working.</li>
                <li>Gain experience with arrays, event handlers, and Math.random() functions.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <u>Demo Files</u>:<br>
                Download this folder containing a pre-written script to get started: [<a
                    href="/assets/demo-files/CD-Studio-JavaScript_Magic-8-Ball-Demo.zip">CD-Studio-JavaScript_Magic-8-Ball-Demo.zip</a>].
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Guidelines</u>:<br>
                You may come up with your own set of responses or use the classic 8 Ball answers. Think about the design and typography
                of the page and how you can expand upon the original format given the unique parameters of a website. You need not
                adhere to the Magic 8 Ball aesthetic in any way, in fact I encourage you to stray far from it.
            </p>
            <p>  
                Incorporate at least one level of complication to the provided script. Examples of this could be including a visual
                change for affirmative, non-commital, or negative answers
                <span class="inline-code">if(elem.classList.contains(‘negative’)){...}</span>, or creating a button to load a new answer without reloading the page. Think outside of the box and see what kind of interventions you can come up with.
