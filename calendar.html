                    Convert your design into an HTML and CSS web page. Be mindful of how the content adapts to a very narrow or very wide browser window. Follow the guide set forth by your sketch from last week, but don't be afraid to make changes once you see how the design feels in the browser.

                    Start to establish an organized folder structure for this class. For example:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    my-homepage/<br>
                    ├─ index.html<br>
                    ├─ css/<br>
                    │&nbsp;&nbsp;├─ style.css<br>
                    ├─ projects/

                    We will host all our work for the semester using GitHub Pages. The instructions for creating a live website using your GitHub account can be found here: [<a href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com</a>]. Please familiarize yourself with the process of setting up a repository with your username.github.io to publish a new site.

                    JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. We use HTML to specify the <u>content</u> of web pages, CSS to specify the <u>presentation</u> of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the <u>behavior</u> of web pages. Before learning JavaScript, it is important to have a strong understanding of the building blocks of the web. To begin, we will practice our HTML and CSS skills by creating a homepage to catalog the rest of the projects for this course.

                    Sketch your website outside of the browser using the tools you feel most comfortable with (for example: InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma, Sketch, or even pencil and paper). Consider the design of your page, how would you like to represent yourself graphically? You may use any combination of text, colors, and images. The only requirement is to include a container which will eventually link to each of your individual projects. Fully realize as much of your homepage as possible without coding yet.
