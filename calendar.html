                    JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. We use HTML to specify the <u>content</u> of web pages, CSS to specify the <u>presentation</u> of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the <u>behavior</u> of web pages. Before learning JavaScript, it is important to have a strong understanding of the building blocks of the web. To begin, we will practice our HTML and CSS skills by creating a homepage to catalog the rest of the projects for this course.

                    Sketch your website outside of the browser using the tools you feel most comfortable with (for example: InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma, Sketch, or even pencil and paper). Consider the design of your page, how would you like to represent yourself graphically? You may use any combination of text, colors, and images. The only requirement is to include a container which will eventually link to each of your individual projects. Fully realize as much of your homepage as possible without coding yet.
